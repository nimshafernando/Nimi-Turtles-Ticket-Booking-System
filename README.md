# Turtle Hatchery Ticket Booking System üê¢

**A Simple Web Application for Ticket Booking and Management**

This is the first coding project I ever completed: a **Turtle Hatchery** website built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The website includes a **ticket booking system** implemented with JavaScript and **local storage** to manage bookings. This project helped me understand the fundamentals of web development, DOM manipulation, and client-side storage.
